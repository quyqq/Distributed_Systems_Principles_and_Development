Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) 
enables the local invocation and remote invocation use the same syntax to implement a generic 
remote server like the Compute Engine. The application 
background of such a compute engine is to utilise the compute-power of a high-performance 
computer or cluster. That is, a client prepares compute-tasks and submits them to the server for 
execution. Java RMI framework needs two HTTP servers to transfer Java classes between an RMI 
client and an RMI server at runtime. In addition, Java RMI applications need an RMI Registry to
register or look up the remote objects. In this assignment, you are to implement a remote 
invocation framework that is similar to Java RMI but lightweight .
Java TCP streaming, object serialization, multithreading and client/server model are the 
fundamental Java components to build distributed applications.
